# Atom is awesome.

Right now I'm typing, and the screen is shaking at each press on a key, with particles flying everywhere.

It's fun 5 minutes, but I'm getting tired of it, so I'll disable it with `ctrl+alt+o`, and uninstall the package.

There. It's gone.

# Installed packages

## The bare necessities

### building blocks
These are packages kind of every atom user I know has installed. It's simply unpleasant without them.

-   [minimap](https://atom.io/packages/minimap)
-   [linter](https://atom.io/packages/linter)
-   [pigments](https://atom.io/packages/pigments)
-   [tool bar](https://atom.io/packages/tool-bar)
-   [highlight selected](https://atom.io/packages/highlight-selected)

Only two of them work fine out of the box though. So you gotta give them some flavor:


-   [minimap git diff](https://atom.io/packages/minimap-git-diff)
-   [minimap pigments](https://atom.io/packages/minimap-pigments)
-   [minimap bookmarks](https://atom.io/packages/minimap-bookmarks)
-   [minimap cursor line](https://atom.io/packages/minimap-cursorline)
-   [minimap highlight selected](https://atom.io/packages/minimap-highlight-selected)
-   [minimap linter](https://atom.io/packages/minimap-linter)
-   [minimap selection](https://atom.io/packages/minimap-selection)
-   [minimap code glance](https://atom.io/packages/minimap-codeglance)
