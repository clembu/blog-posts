## The Faceless Panda

I don't remember how or when I got the idea. But it comes down to a single image that popped up
in my head. The creepy gory image of a cute chibi-manga-like panda with its face ripped off.

**It's horrible.**

The name I chose to go by in a number of places on the internet comes from the unnecessarily violent
idea of a lethally injured endangered-species animal.

But I actually think it's **a fitting name**.

Pandas are *totally **dependant on humanity*** to function normally,
as I can't be productive without anybody to either impress or
live up to their expectations.
**I need peer pressure to do things.**
This blog originally was a *playground for me to test jekyll out*.
I intended to write things and put them on it, but well,
*it's been a year and I never wrote* a single post for this until now.
Today I'm writing an introductory post to future projects that exist
**solely to connect to people**.

These projects are mostly about **roleplaying games**.
Not those MMORPGs or Skyrim or other Zelda, but
*good old tabletop live-action roleplaying games*.
It's something that I love doing, *imagining worlds*
and *playing as various characters*, putting myself in *shoes that I don't own*,
**wearing all kinds of masks**.
I end up having so many faces that I don't really have any.

Hence **the panda with no face**.

## Games to come

### Some homebrew stuff

I've started **role-playing with friends** recently, as a game master,
directing **my own campaign set in a world I built** over nearly ten years.

I would like to post party character details and session summaries, but
I never prepared for this kind of stuff. It's my first game and I underestimated
the importance of taking notes. This lead to a messy game kind-of unpleasant for everyone.
So I'm hesitating to just start it again with an actually prepared campaign.
This is something I will discuss with my players.

So, I may add a sub-section with the party characters info, session stories, and stuff,
from that game, at some point. But not now.

### Call of Cthulhu â€” 1890

In the near future, though, I will be playing in a **Call of Cthulhu** game. Not as GM though.

My character is **Edward DuMoulin**, you can find his bio
[on the site]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link games/cthulhu/edward.md %}).

I have added a **[summary page of the game]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link games/cthulhu.md %})**.
Kind of like a hub. You can find links to character bios and session summaries.
It will be updated each time there's something new.

For each game I will be playing, there's gonna be a similar hub.

I'm committed now. This little blog-site-thing is gonna be my game story vault.
