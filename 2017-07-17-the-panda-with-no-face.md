# The Faceless Panda

I don't remember how or when I got the idea. But it comes down to a single image that popped up
in my head. The creepy gory image of a cute chibi-manga-like panda with its face ripped off.

**It's horrible.**

The name I chose to go by in a number of places on the internet comes from the unnecessarily violent
idea of a lethally injured endangered-species animal.

But I actually think it's **a fitting name**.

Pandas are *totally **dependant on humanity*** to function normally,
as I can't be productive without anybody to either impress or
live up to their expectations.
**I need peer pressure to do things.**
This blog originally was a playground for me to test jekyll out.
I intended to write things and put them on it, but well,
it's been a year and I never wrote a single post for this until now.
Today I'm writing an introductory post to future projects that exist
**solely to connect to people**.

These projects are mostly about **roleplaying games**.
Not those MMORPGs or Skyrim or other Zelda, but
good old tabletop live-action roleplaying games.
It's something that I love doing, imagining worlds
and playing as various characters, putting myself in shoes that I don't own,
**wearing all kinds of masks**.
I end up having so many faces that I don't really have any.

Hence **the panda with no face**.
